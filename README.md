#### Oh ello there! I am Elicia and welcome to my Github Respository for GOSweet. All my code for this application will be stored here for your viewing. I be creating a front-end web application to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery and API coding. Sit back and enjoy! üòé

### GOSweet

  Love socialzing with people? 
  Love meeting new friends? 
  Love good competition? 
  Love to know where your friends are exactly and stock them? 

  Well then, GOSweet is the perfect web-application for you! 
  GOSweet is a **free** to sign up app that allows you to socialize with people all around Singapore through a large messaging portal called Sweet Tea. Interested to find out where your friends are?

* **Is that all? That quite lame... is there any other features?** 
  What about a little bit of competition huh? 
  GOSweet has an inbuilt game called Sweet-Venture that can be played by any Ngee Ann Polytechnic student! This game requires students to find the 3 hidden locations around campus. The faster your timing, the higher you will be placed on the leaderboard. Compete with friends to see who can top the leaderboard!

* **Target users?** 
  GOSweet is mainly targeted towards "youngsters"  also known as Millennials and Gen-Z as well as Ngee Ann Polytecnic students. Of course this does not mean that others are not welcomed to use GOSweet. Dont feel FOMO!! Of course all with a young heart are welcomed to join in the fun!!
